# Magickat Social API

## Description
**Magickat Social**ðŸ”® is a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list using Express.js and MongoDB (Mongoose). This week in the UW Coding Bootcamp, we learned about MongoDB - a document-oriented database program. MongoDB is capable of storing and querying data like SQL, but has a few key benefits, such as:
- Flexible document schemas (objects stored in collections)
- Change-friendly design
- Easy to install & get started
- Widely supported

When coupled with Node.js and Express.js, we can quickly and easily design a fully functional RESTful application that accepts, stores, and queries user information. This simple but useful application can serve as a great baseline for those looking to build a social media application without having to handle the specifics in querying and joining with SQL. Working with MongoDB in creating this application has showed me it's value and ease in creating RESTful API's.
